//! Markdown → 1-bit bitmap rendering, lowered onto the rich-text renderer.
//!
//! Supported mapping (anything else renders as its inner text or is skipped):
//! headings (bold 36/30/26 px, blank line before and after), paragraphs
//! (regular 24 px, blank line after), bold/italic emphasis, inline code
//! (passthrough — the font is monospace anyway), bullet and ordered lists
//! (indent 24 px per nesting level, `• ` / `N. ` prefixes), fenced and
//! indented code blocks (regular 20 px, indent 16 px, exact line breaks
//! preserved), blockquotes (indent 24 px, italic), and horizontal rules
//! (full-width 2 px bar with 12 px margins), strikethrough (`~~text~~`, a
//! 2 px line through the text), task-list checkboxes (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`,
//! rendered as ASCII `[ ]` / `[x]` markers — JetBrains Mono has no ballot-box
//! glyphs), and a tear marker: a thematic break written with interior spaces
//! (`- - -`) renders as a dashed line (8 px on / 8 px off) instead of a solid
//! rule. Links render their inner text only; raw HTML is skipped.
//! Tables render as monospace text blocks (code-style Regular 20 px): each
//! cell's inline content flattens to plain text (bold/italic dropped), columns
//! are padded to their widest cell with two-space gutters, a dashed separator
//! row follows the header, and over-wide tables shrink their widest columns —
//! truncating cells with `…` — to fit the 384 px roll. Left-aligned only;
//! markdown alignment markers are ignored. Widths are counted in *display
//! columns*, so a full-width CJK character claims two and a table mixing
//! Japanese and ASCII rows still lines up. The shrink has a floor (3 columns
//! per table column), so the roll fits **at most six columns**: seven or more
//! need more than the 32-column budget even at the floor, and the rows
//! word-wrap instead, losing column alignment. Nothing panics and no ink
//! leaves the paper — the table just stops being a table.
//!
//! Standalone top-level `<!-- align: left|center|right -->` comments select
//! text alignment for following blocks; the default is left for each document.
//!
//! Three fence names turn a code block into a graphic instead of text, matched
//! case-insensitively on the info string's first word (so ` ```QR ` and
//! ` ```barcode utf8 ` both count): ` ```qr ` encodes its trimmed body as a QR
//! code (`qr width=240` optionally limits its square including the quiet zone),
//! ` ```barcode ` as a Code128 barcode (printable ASCII only, 28
//! characters max — see [`barcode`](super::barcode)), and ` ```wagara ` draws a
//! traditional Japanese pattern band (see [`wagara`](super::wagara)). A wagara
//! fence names its pattern in the info string's second token
//! (` ```wagara seigaiha `) or, failing that, on the body's first non-empty
//! line; the remaining body lines are `key: value` options. Every other info
//! string, including none at all, still renders as plain code text. Input the
//! renderer rejects prints its error message as code text: a bad fence never
//! panics or costs the reader the rest of the document.
//!
//! Images are rendered in two passes, because this crate is sans-IO and never
//! fetches anything: [`markdown_image_refs`] lists a document's image
//! destinations, the caller decodes and dithers each one to a [`Bitmap`] its own
//! way, and [`render_markdown_with`] renders the document against that map. A
//! destination present in the map is stacked as its own block with
//! [`IMAGE_MARGIN`] px of white above and below.
//!
//! **Behavior change (Phase 5):** an image whose destination is *not* in the map
//! used to be dropped silently, alt text and all. It now renders an italic
//! placeholder line — `[image: <alt text>]`, falling back to `[image: <dest>]`
//! when there is no alt text — at the surrounding indent, so it nests inside
//! lists and blockquotes. [`render_markdown`] delegates to
//! [`render_markdown_with`] with an empty map, so every caller that has not been
//! taught to supply images now prints placeholders where it used to print
//! nothing.
//!
//! Deviation from the plan's break mapping: a soft break renders as a space
//! (standard markdown behavior, reads better on a 384 px roll); only a hard
//! break starts a new line. Trailing blank space after the last block is
//! trimmed, as are blank lines abutting a horizontal rule (the rule carries
//! its own margins).
